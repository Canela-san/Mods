nexusDescription="This is a modding tool for SMAPI mods, to add a condition checking system to their mods, usually for use with content packs. This was created because there was a need in several of my own mods, and moving the conditions system to a separate mod allows me to maintain and update it for all my frameworks, and makes it available for any other mods to use.\n<br />\n<br />This mod does nothing on its own\n<br />\n<br />[u]Instructions for players:[/u]\n<br />If a mod has this mod as a requirement, all you need to do is download and drop it into your mods folder\n<br />\n<br />[u]Instructions for modders:[/u]\n<br />Whether you are creating a mod to use Expanded Preconditions Utility, or a content maker creating a content pack using this, you can find all details in the [url=https://github.com/ChroniclerCherry/stardew-valley-mods/blob/master/ExpandedPreconditionsUtility/README.md]README[/url]\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />[b]Please make all bug reports in the Bugs tab, not Posts. I do not come on Nexus often and I can't read all the comments, but I will look at bugs.
