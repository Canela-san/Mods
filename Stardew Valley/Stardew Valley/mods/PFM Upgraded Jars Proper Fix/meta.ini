nexusDescription="Upgraded Versions of the original Preserve Jars, with improved space efficiency. The Jars come in Copper (x10), Iron (x25), Gold (x50), Iridium (x100) varieties.\n<br />\n<br />This is meant to be a JA/PFM replacement for the CFR Mod.   \n<br />\n<br />\n<br />The other fix [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/14533]version[/url] that was released here didn't take into account when adding Aged Roe support, the different coloured Roe and it's coloured Aged counterparts. It also forgot to take into account Caviar being produced from Sturgeon Roe as well as Pickling Ginger. This version fixes all of those bugs. The other fix also lacks a No Quality Bonus version. I also altered the recipe &amp; base costs to incentivise crafting the jars. No other changes have been made.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />Original mod: [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/5181]PFM Upgraded Jars[/url]"
