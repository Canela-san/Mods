nexusDescription="This is a compiled version of the plugin available at [url=https://github.com/iarspider/Minidew-Mods/tree/master/FriendsForever]https://github.com/iarspider/Minidew-Mods/tree/master/FriendsForever[/url]\n<br />\n<br />I've compiled it for my own use, and realised it was enough of a pain figuring out how to compile from source that I should share it.\n<br />\n<br />---------------\n<br />\n<br />This mod prevents friendship points from decaying each day if you haven't talked to a NPC or petted an animal. By default, the friendship between your spouse and you WILL decay but this can easily be changed in the config file. It's a simple mod so there isn't much to say or show about it. Do note that other reasons for friendship decreasing (sifting trash, starving animals, etc) will still lower friendship levels.\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />In the config file you can change whether this mod effects (you will need to launch the game once):\n<br />[list]\n<br />[*]Spouses (disabled by default)\n<br />[*]Dates\n<br />[*]Other NPCs\n<br />[*]Animals\n<br />[/list]Installation:\n<br />Simply extract the zip into your mods folder.\n<br />\n<br />Note:\n<br />I am currently fairly busy and may be behind updating the mod. I'm far more likely to reply if I'm contacted on GitHub.\n<br />\n<br />Source and Contributions:\n<br />You can find the source for this mod [url=https://github.com/isaacs-dev/Minidew-Mods]here[/url]. Contributions are welcome.\n<br />\n<br />------------------------------\n<br />\n<br />The original Dev hasn't been active since early 2020."
