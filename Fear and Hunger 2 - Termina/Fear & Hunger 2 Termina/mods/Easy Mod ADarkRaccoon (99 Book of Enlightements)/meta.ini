nexusDescription="This has been something that EVERYONE asked me all the time. . . I have waited a long time for this since no one has done a mod like this one and people keep asking around so it's best to provide than to ignore the community.\n<br />\n<br />Have you ever struggled with the game that you need to practice specific moments in the game that you just can't seem to understand because of how difficult it is. . . Or are you just in the mood to cheat through the game because it deserves it!?\n<br />\n<br />Sit down, install my mod from a clean installation and you will find a character near the train that has 99 Books of Enlightenments that you can loot over and over again whenever you need it~!\n<br />\n<br />How To Patch:\n<br />Step 1- Download my patch https://drive.google.com/file/d/10S96Gh2KOEENOIkkz6stvS6XB1RP9EFA/view?usp=sharing\n<br />Step 2- Extract the downloaded .rar file \n<br />Step 3- Move the \"www\" folder to the game's directory and overwrite everything\n<br />\n<br />To be able to tell if this patch worked there should be a raccoon on the main menu as well as the text \"Easy Mode By ADarkRaccoon\"\n<br />\n<br />[youtube]klNf121v0c0[/youtube]"
